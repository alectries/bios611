# Data Background

The data used for this report was downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information, part of NOAA. Each year's data can be found as a compressed CSV file in [NCEI's Storm Events files](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/). The StormEvents_details files from 1974 to 2024 were pulled for this analysis.

Below is a map of every storm event recorded with location data from 1974 to 2024.
