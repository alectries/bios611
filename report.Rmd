# Data Background

The data used for this report was downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), part of NOAA. Each year's data can be found as a compressed CSV file in [NCEI's Storm Events files](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/). The StormEvents_details files from 1974 to 2024 were pulled for this analysis.

Below is a map of all storm events recorded with location data from 1974 to 2024 that were in or near the continental United States.

That's a ton of weather events. Here are just the events from the last 20 years:

And here are just tornadoes from the last 20 years, as an example:

The dataset contains a significant amount of information about each storm event. Details about the included information can be located in the [codebook](./source_data/stormevents_codebook.pdf).

# Principal Component Analysis

PCA was used to find the variables in the data with the most variability across observations in the data that were complete cases with respect to quantitative data available.

These tables show the rotations of the first and second principal components. The higher the absolute value of a variable's rotation, the more variability it has in the data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
readRDS("plots/kable_pc1.rds") %>% 
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c("PC1" = 2)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_material()
readRDS("plots/kable_pc2.rds") %>% 
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c("PC2" = 2)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_material()
```

This analysis shows that monetary damage to property and crops are the most variable items in the data and that property and crop damage do not vary in tandem. The next section of the report will illustrate the variability in property damage in terms of the affected location.

# Risk to Property

For this analysis, the kmeans algorithm was used to cluster storm events according to their location (as longitude and latitude) and the recorded amount of property damage they caused. After several trials and a visual analysis, grouping into five clusters appeared most appropriate.

The following visualization shows clusters by latitude (on the vertical axis) and property damage (with the events furthest to the right representing the greatest damage). Each point is a unique storm event.

![](plots/plot_klat.png)

The most damaging storms in the dataset all occurred near the 30th parallel. Other damaging storms generally occurred in the southern part of the United States, whose 48 continental states are between the 25th and 50th parallels.

The next visualization shows clusters by longitude (on the horizontal axis) and property damage (with the events highest on the chart representing the greatest damage). Again, each point is a unique storm event. Cluster colors are conserved.

![](plots/plot_klon.png)

Here, it is apparent that most highly damaging storms occur between 80 and 100 degrees West â€“ these longitudes surround the Gulf of Mexico and represent the most vulnerable parts of the American Southeast to hurricanes.

Last, a map has been generated from the clustered data. The size of the point corresponds to the amount of property damage done by the storm, and the color represents the cluster. You'll notice one cluster has been removed from this visualization: that cluster includes the vast majority of storms that were minimally damaging and would overcrowd the map if displayed.

![](plots/plot_kmap.png)

This analysis confirms what we generally know to be true: that the most damaging storms tend to occur near the Gulf of Mexico, and that damaging storms most commonly occur throughout the Southeast and Midwest. It is interesting that the most damaging storms in the dataset are all near Houston, Texas; this is potentially due to a lack of geographic data for many storms in the data, with hurricane location data frequently missing.

# Narratives

Each storm event in the data has a free-text narrative field, which contains written details of the event listed. These are the top 50 words in the dataset, when stopwords are removed:

![](plots/plot_top50.png)

To demonstrate the relative frequency of different weather event types in the data, a selection of terms derived from event types is shown below.

![](plots/plot_weatherterms.png)

The frequency of words in the narrative sections varies widely by event type. Displayed below are the top 20 words for each of a selection of event types.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
readRDS("plots/kable_wordsbytype.rds") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Event Type" = 7)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_material()
```

Due to the uniqueness of these descriptions, the narrative fields contain terms that may be useful in identifying an event type even if one is not present. This would be an interesting topic for further analysis given more time.

# Conclusions

The data in the storm events files are largely as expected. The conclusions of this report are as follows:

1. Of the quantitative variables provided, property damage and crop damage are highly variable.
2. The greatest property damage by storm events in the United States tends to occur in the Southeast, where property is most vulnerable to hurricanes. Property damage is otherwise spread throughout the continental 48 states, though the mountain states appear less vulnerable.
3. The narrative descriptions of storms differ widely by storm type and may be useful in classifying historical weather events with poor data collection standards.
